## Handlebars Development Server

#### Description

This package is a development server for handlebars templates. It watches for changes in the `template.hbs` and `context.json`. After each change server will render your template and write it to the ```index.html```. You dont have to reload the browser while you make changes on the ```template.hbs```Â or ```context.json```.



#### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local device
2. Run ```pnpm i``` or ```npm i```

3. Start the server with the command ```pnpm start``` or ```npm run start```

4. While server is running, you can change the content of the ```context.json``` and ```template.hbs``` to create your desired handlebars template.
